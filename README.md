# project_template
This is a file structure I use for my research project. Use it with Obsidian preferably. Its strength is that one can use this file structure recursively by copying the same structure again into the folder 03_projects in order to add subprojects. This folder may be renamed "studies" within a subproject folder.

## Example

```
MainProjectTemplate    <-- rename according to project title
| 01_literature
| 02_talks
| 03_projects
| | SubProject_1_Template    <-- rename according to project title
| | | 01_literature
| | | 02_talks
| | | 03_studies
| | | 04_writeup
| | | 05_staff
| | | 4Qs_SubProject_1    <-- rename according to project title
| | SubProject_2_Template    <-- rename according to project title
| | | 01_literature
| | | | 01_consume
| | | | 02_engage
| | | 02_talks
| | | 03_studies
| | | | 01_data
| | | | 02_analysis
| | | 04_writeup
| | | 05_staff
| | | 4Qs_SubProject_2    <-- rename according to project title
| 04_writeup
| 05_staff
| 4Qs_MainProject    <-- rename according to project title
```
