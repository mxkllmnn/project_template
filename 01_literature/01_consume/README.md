# 01_literature/01_consume/
Put any literature in here that you have to read (again) but did not find the time yet.
To reduce overhead you can create symbolic links to sources from other project outside this vault (for OSX: "cd" into the respective folder; then use "ln -s <source>").

Note: You may want to delete this README file after personal files have been added.
