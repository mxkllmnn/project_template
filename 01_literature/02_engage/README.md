Create Notes (preferably markdown files) as working documents for a corresponding resource (.pdf file) from the 01_consume folder. Use the same name as for the file from 01_consume source file and add anything of importance. I like to add the source file as a hyperlink [[<filename>]|title]

Note: You may want to delete this README file after personal files have been added.
